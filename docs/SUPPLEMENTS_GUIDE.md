## 1. Skin Supplements

### Collagen Peptides

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Dosage** | 10-20g hydrolyzed collagen peptides daily |
| **Evidence Level** | Moderate - 11 clinical studies with 805 patients showed improvements in skin elasticity, hydration, and dermal collagen density |
| **Timeline** | 3-6 months for visible results |
| **Cost/Month** | $15-30 |
| **Side Effects** | Generally safe; rare GI discomfort |
| **Interactions** | None significant |

**Key Points:**
- Hydrolyzed (peptide) form is best absorbed
- Take with 500-1000mg Vitamin C to boost synthesis
- Co-factors: Zinc (10-15mg), Copper (1-3mg)
- Avoid: High glycemic foods, UV damage, smoking (all break down collagen)

### Vitamin C

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Dosage** | 500-1000mg daily |
| **Evidence Level** | Strong - Essential for collagen synthesis and antioxidant protection |
| **Timeline** | 4-8 weeks for skin brightness improvements |

| **Side Effects** | GI upset at high doses (>2000mg) |
| **Interactions** | Enhances iron absorption |

### Zinc

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Dosage** | 25-50mg daily (Zinc Picolinate preferred) |
| **Evidence Level** | Strong for acne, moderate for general skin health |
| **Timeline** | 4-8 weeks |
| **Cost/Month** | $5-10 |
| **Side Effects** | Nausea if taken without food; can deplete copper at high doses |
| **Interactions** | Do not exceed 50mg daily; balance with copper (2mg copper per 30mg zinc) |

**Key Points:**
- Supports testosterone, skin clarity, and oil control
- Picolinate form is most bioavailable
- Take with food to avoid nausea

### Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Dosage** | 1000-2000mg combined EPA/DHA daily |
| **Evidence Level** | Strong for skin inflammation and hydration |
| **Timeline** | 6-12 weeks |
| **Cost/Month** | $15-50 (quality fish oil) |
| **Side Effects** | Fishy burps, minor GI effects |
| **Interactions** | May increase bleeding risk with blood thinners |

**Key Points:**
- Anti-inflammatory; reduces acne and improves skin texture

## 2. Hair Supplements

### Biotin (Vitamin B7)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Dosage** | 2.5-5mg (2500-5000mcg) daily |
| **Evidence Level** | Weak - Only beneficial if deficient (38% of hair loss patients had low biotin) |
| **Timeline** | 3-4 months |
| **Cost/Month** | $5-15 |
| **Side Effects** | Interferes with lab tests (thyroid, cardiac) |
| **Interactions** | Can affect immunoassay results - inform doctor before blood tests |

**Key Points:**
- Most people get adequate biotin from diet
- Only supplement if deficiency is documented
- Signs of deficiency: Thinning hair, brittle nails, scaly rash around mouth/eyes

### Saw Palmetto

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Dosage** | 160-320mg daily (standardized extract with 85-95% fatty acids) |
| **Evidence Level** | Moderate - 60% improvement in hair quality in RCTs; reduces DHT by ~32% |

| **Cost/Month** | $10-25 |
| **Side Effects** | GI discomfort, headache, dizziness (5% of users) |
| **Interactions** | Blood thinners, hormone therapies; avoid during pregnancy |

**Key Points:**
- Natural 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (like finasteride but weaker)

- Best combined with other nutrients like biotin and zinc

### Pumpkin Seed Oil

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Dosage** | 400mg daily |
| **Evidence Level** | Limited - One RCT showed 40% increase in hair count over 24 weeks |
| **Timeline** | 12-24 weeks |
| **Cost/Month** | $10-20 |
| **Side Effects** | Generally well tolerated |
| **Interactions** | None significant |

**Important Caveat:** The primary study used a multi-ingredient formula (Octa-Sabal Plus), not pure pumpkin seed oil. Evidence is considered weak.

## 3. Bone/Growth Supplements

### Vitamin D3

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Dosage** | 2000-5000 IU daily (minimum 1000 IU; some use up to 10,000 IU) |
| **Evidence Level** | Strong for bone health; moderate for height (mainly if deficient) |
| **Timeline** | 8-12 weeks to normalize levels |
| **Cost/Month** | $5-10 |
| **Side Effects** | Toxicity rare but possible at very high doses (>10,000 IU long-term) |
| **Interactions** | Take with fat for absorption; pair with K2 |

**Key Points:**
- Critical for calcium absorption and bone health
- Deficiency common (especially in northern climates)
- 1000 IU is maintenance; 5000 IU for optimization
- Get blood levels tested (aim for 40-60 ng/mL)

### Vitamin K2 (MK-7)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Dosage** | 100-200mcg daily (MK-7 form preferred) |
| **Evidence Level** | Moderate - Works synergistically with D3 for bone mineral density |
| **Timeline** | 6-12 months for bone density changes |
| **Cost/Month** | $10-20 |
| **Side Effects** | Very rare |
| **Interactions** | Blood thinners (warfarin) - consult doctor |

**Key Points:**
- Directs calcium to bones, away from arteries
- Essential co-factor with Vitamin D3
- Take together with D3 and fat-containing meal

### Calcium

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Dosage** | 500-1000mg daily (if dietary intake is low) |
| **Evidence Level** | Strong for bone health when combined with D3/K2 |
| **Timeline** | Long-term supplementation required |
| **Cost/Month** | $5-10 |
| **Side Effects** | Constipation; excess may increase cardiovascular risk |
| **Interactions** | Take separately from iron, zinc, thyroid meds |

**Height Growth Note:** For younger users with open growth plates, ensuring adequate D3, K2, and calcium may support natural height potential. No supplement can increase height after growth plates close (typically ages 18-25).

## 4. Hormonal Optimization

### Ashwagandha (KSM-66 or Sensoril)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Dosage** | 300-600mg standardized extract daily |
| **Evidence Level** | Moderate - 15% testosterone increase; 18% DHEA-S increase in studies |
| **Timeline** | 8-12 weeks |
| **Cost/Month** | $15-30 |
| **Side Effects** | GI upset, drowsiness; may cause hyperthyroidism in susceptible individuals |
| **Interactions** | Thyroid medications, sedatives, immunosuppressants |

**Key Points:**

- Considered "GOD-tier" in looksmaxxing communities

### Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma longifolia)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Dosage** | 200-400mg daily (standardized extract) |
| **Evidence Level** | Moderate - Increases free testosterone by reducing SHBG |
| **Timeline** | 4-12 weeks |
| **Cost/Month** | $20-40 |
| **Side Effects** | Restlessness, insomnia, irritability |
| **Interactions** | May affect blood sugar; caution with diabetes medications |

### Boron

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Dosage** | 3-10mg daily |
| **Evidence Level** | Weak to Moderate - Reduces SHBG, may increase free testosterone |
| **Timeline** | 1-2 weeks for hormonal changes |
| **Cost/Month** | $5-10 |
| **Side Effects** | Generally well tolerated |
| **Interactions** | None significant |

**Note:** Evidence is conflicting. Some studies show benefit, others show no effect.

### Legal Considerations for Testosterone/HGH

**Testosterone:**
- Prescription only (TRT requires diagnosis of hypogonadism)
- Natural optimization through sleep, exercise, diet, stress reduction first
- Blood tests required before and during treatment

**HGH (Human Growth Hormone):**
- Prescription only; illegal without prescription
- Very expensive ($500-1500+/month)
- Significant side effects with unsupervised use

## 5. Anti-Aging Supplements

### NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Dosage** | 250-500mg daily (some go up to 1000mg) |
