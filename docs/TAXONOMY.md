# LOOKSMAXX Complete Taxonomy of Facial Measurements

This document provides a comprehensive reference of all facial measurements, ratios, and scoring categories used by LOOKSMAXX and similar facial analysis systems.

## Overview

There are two main LOOKSMAXX services:

1. **LOOKSMAXX** (looksmaxx-app.vercel.app / beta.looksmaxx-app.vercel.app) - 60+ facial ratios with percentile rankings
2. **Premium Analysis** (Gumroad) - 47 cephalometric measurements with detailed reports

Both use similar underlying measurement principles but differ in implementation.

| **Supraorbital Projection** | Deep-set eyes, strong projection | Less pronounced |
| **Cheekbones** | Wide, laterally projected | Higher, less wide |
| **Mandible Width** | Broader, wider jaw | Narrower, tapered |
| **Chin** | Square, forward projection | Rounded, narrower |
| **Gonion** | Angular, flared outward | Softer angle |
| **Ramus Height** | Taller (avg 66.5mm male) | Shorter |
| **Nose** | Larger, wider | Smaller, narrower |

## 3. ANGULARITY SCORE (15-22% weight)

**Definition:** Sharpness, definition, and three-dimensionality of facial contours. Heavily influenced by body fat percentage.

### Optimal Body Fat for Angularity
- Males: 9-12% body fat
- Females: 17-20% body fat
- Cheekbones emerge at: 10-15% (M) / 15-20% (F)

### Key Angularity Features

| Feature | High Angularity | Low Angularity |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Mandible** | Visible, clear contour, flared | Hidden, soft edges |
| **Gonion** | Sharp, defined angle | Rounded, undefined |
| **Cheekbones** | High projection, visible contours | Flat, hidden |
| **Chin** | Defined edges, angular | Rounded, soft |
| **Overall Face** | 3D depth, shadows | Flat, 2D appearance |
| **Jawline** | Sharp, continuous line | Interrupted by fat |

### Measurement Factors

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Perimeter-to-Area Ratio | Predicts BMI from face |
| Cheek-to-Jaw Width Ratio | Higher = leaner appearance |
| Lower Face Outline Shape | Angular vs. rounded |
| Mandible Visibility | Definition level |
| Subcutaneous Fat | Less = more angular |

| Aspect | Harmony Score | Features Score |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Focus** | Proportions and ratios | Individual feature quality |

## 6. PROFILE-SPECIFIC SCORING

### Front Profile (61% of harmony points - 307 pts)

Key measurements weighted by importance:
1. Facial thirds proportion
2. FWHR
3. Eye spacing and canthal tilt
4. Jaw frontal angle
5. Bigonial-bizygomatic ratio

### Side Profile (39% of harmony points - 196 pts)

Key measurements weighted by importance:
1. Gonial angle
2. Facial convexity
3. Nasolabial angle
4. Mandibular plane angle
5. Nasal projection

---

## 7. OVERALL SCORE CALCULATION

### Step 1: Normalize Each Category (0-100)

```
Score = ((Raw - Minimum) / (Maximum - Minimum)) × 100
```

### Step 2: Apply Weights

```
Overall = (HARM × 0.32) + (MISC × 0.26) + (ANGU × 0.22) + (DIMO × 0.20)
```

### Step 3: Apply Harmony Imbalance Penalty

```
Penalty = (Highest Score - Lowest Score) × 0.5
Final Score = Overall - Penalty
```

This penalty prevents artificially high scores when one category is strong but others are weak.

## 10. MEASUREMENT COUNT SUMMARY

| Category | Front Profile | Side Profile | Total |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| Harmony Ratios | ~34 | ~21 | ~55 |
| Dimorphism Markers | ~6 | ~4 | ~10 |
| Angularity Factors | ~5 | ~3 | ~8 |
| Feature Assessments | ~25 | ~5 | ~30 |
| **Total Unique Measurements** | ~70 | ~33 | **~60-100** |

This accounts for the "60+ measurements" claim from LOOKSMAXX and the "47 cephalometric measurements" from Premium Analysis, with the difference coming from how features vs. ratios are counted.
