## LOOKSMAXX Services Overview

### LOOKSMAXX Products

| Service | Price | Features |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Basic Rating Rating** | $10 | Score /10, percentile, rating description |
| **Premium Analysis Analysis** | Paid | 47 measurements, softmax/hardmax advice, morphs, potential score |
| **LOOKSMAXX** | $25/month | 60+ measurements, front/side harmony scores, percentile rankings |

### LOOKSMAXX Scoring Formula (4 Components)

LOOKSMAXX rates faces using a weighted formula:

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **HARM (Harmony)** | 32% | Proportional balance of facial features |
| **MISC (Miscellaneous)** | 26% | Skin, eyes, coloring, lips, nose, ears |
| **ANGU (Angularity)** | 22% | Facial sharpness and definition |
| **DIMO (Dimorphism)** | 20% | Masculine/feminine characteristics |

**Example Calculation:**
```
Harmony: 6.499 x 0.32 = 2.07968
MISC: 6.916 x 0.26 = 1.79716
ANGU: 3.973 x 0.22 = 0.87406
DIMO: 7.92 x 0.20 = 1.58400
Weighted Average = 6.33490
```

### LOOKSMAXX Score Components

- **Overall Score**: 0-10 with percentile (e.g., 7.42 = Top 12%)
- **Front Profile Score**: Separate measurement (e.g., 7.85 = Top 8%)
- **Side Profile Score**: Distinct evaluation (e.g., 6.98 = Top 18%)

### Severity Classification Levels (LOOKSMAXX)

| Classification | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| **Ideal** | Perfect/optimal range |
| **Excellent** | Near-ideal with minimal deviation |
| **Moderate** | Noticeable deviation (e.g., -1.8%) |
| **Minor** | Small flaw (e.g., -3.2%) |
| **Major Flaw** | Significant deviation requiring attention |

## Detailed HARM Formula (Harmony Score)

Twenty-five proportional measurements across 7 tiers:

Major factors include:
- Jaw width
- Eye-brow distance
- Brow ridge angle
- Facial thirds (1:1:1 ratio)
- Nasofrontal angle (125-135 degrees)
- Neck width
- FWHR (1.8-2.0)
- Eye aspect ratio
- Gonial angle (~120 degrees)
- Ramus length
- Chin-philtrum ratio (~1:2)
- Lateral canthal tilt
- Bizygomatic width (140-150mm)
- Midface height (47-50mm)

**Range:** Max 389.74 / Min -409.92

---

## Overall Score Calculation

1. Normalize each component to 0-100 scale:
   `((Score - Min) / (Max - Min)) x 100`

2. Apply weighted percentages:
   - HARM x 0.32
   - MISC x 0.26
   - ANGU x 0.22
   - DIMO x 0.20

3. Calculate spread between highest and lowest component

4. Apply penalty: `Spread x 0.5`

5. **Final Score** = Weighted average - Penalty

The penalty mechanism prevents high scores in isolated categories from inflating overall ratings when other areas are deficient.

## Severity Classifications

### Point Deviation System

| Deviation | Impact | Classification |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Within ideal range | +Full points | Ideal |
| +/- 0.1 from FWHR ideal | -5 points | Minor deviation |
| Well outside range | -25 points (~5% total) | Major flaw |

### "Major Flaw" vs "Minor Flaw"

Based on forum discussions:

| Flaw Type | Definition | Examples |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Major Flaw** | Significantly impacts overall attractiveness, noticeable at first glance | Recessed chin, very high gonial angle (>130), submental fullness, severe asymmetry |
| **Minor Flaw** | Noticeable but doesn't significantly detract | Slightly long philtrum, minor asymmetry, slightly wide nose |
